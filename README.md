# Locator-app
This application allows to save places where you have been and display them on the map.
# Tools used
Python language. Python libraries (geopy.geocoders, pandas, folium, webbrowser).
Tkinter GUI, CSV file to collect locations.

# How it works
You have a choice to add exact adress or just a city. App calculates latitude and longitude and saves it into csv file. You can open location 
in the map to see where it is. By choice possible to filter which locations you want to see (work related, vacation, home, other).
You can see statistics page where listed top tree countries and cities visited and more.

# Problems
Only problem is that app opens quite slow, especially when .exe file created. When it's open, it works very good.
